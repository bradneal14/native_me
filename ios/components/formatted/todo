- Add red border to yes/no selection on click
- add review opportunity on what is now "results" page

-"edit question" functionality (use AsyncStorage.mergeItem)
-custom number of questions

-view data in a meaningful way
-connect to email for backup

-constraints for not answering more than once per day

- I need to figure out how the rules are going to work, maybe the default setting is
one month for the first trial but you can change that later? Is there a settings page?

-Add a way to choose your pin




PRIORITIES IN ORDER:
- figure out how to properly save the answer data using the date object as the key.
- Add constraint so that you can only answer questions once per minute (will be changed to day)
  + this will be an addition to index.js I think
