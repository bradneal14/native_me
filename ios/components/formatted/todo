- Add red border to yes/no selection on click
- add review opportunity on what is now "results" page

-"edit question" functionality
-custom number of questions

-view data in a meaningful way
-connect to email for backup

-constraints for not posting more than once per day

- I need to figure out how the rules are going to work, maybe the default setting is
